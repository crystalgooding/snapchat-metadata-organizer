Organize downloaded snapchat images by changing the image's metadata

With new snapchat updates, there is a limit on memories's storage. When you mass download the images and videos saved on snapchat, they will save under the date it was downloaded. This program allows for the images to be saved onto a camera roll on the correct date that it was taken. That way, all your snapchat images aren't just at the very end of your camera roll.
